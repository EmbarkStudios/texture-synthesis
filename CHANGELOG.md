## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added `Error::UnsupportedOutputFormat`

### Changed
- CLI: `--out` is now required. `-` can still be passed to write to stdout instead of a file.
- CLI: The file extension for the `--out` path is now checked to see if it a supported format.

### Removed
- Removed tga feature in image since it wasn't used

## [0.4.1] - 2019-09-04
### Fixed
- Removed unused `lodepng` dependency

## [0.4.0] - 2019-09-04
### Changed
- Use [`failure`](https://crates.io/crates/failure) for errors
- CLI: Replaced piston_window with [`minifb`](https://crates.io/crates/minifb)
- CLI: Due to how minifb works via X11, the progress window is now an optional feature
not enabled when building for musl

### Removed
- Removed several codec features from `image`, only `png`, `jpeg`, `bmp`, and `tga` are supported now

## [0.3.0] - 2019-09-03
### Added
- Added [`Example`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L247) and [`ExampleBuilder`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L208) which can be used to manipulate an indidivual
example input before being added to a [`SessionBuilder`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L342)
- Added [`SampleMethod`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L158) used to specify how a particular example is sampled during generation
- Added [`ImageSource`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/utils.rs#L6) which is a small enum that means image data for examples, guides,
masks, etc, can be specified either as paths, raw byte slices, or already loaded `image::DynamicImage`
- Added [`GeneratedImage`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L103) which allows saving, streaming, and inspection of the image
generated by [`Session::run()`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L736)

### Changed
- All usage of `&str` paths to load images from disk have been replaced with `ImageSource`
- Moved all of the building functionality in `Session` into `SessionBuilder`
- [`SessionBuilder::inpaint_example`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L410) now specifies an ImageSource for the 
inpaint mask, along with an `Example` to be paired with, rather than the previous use of an index that 
the user had to keep track of
- [`GeneratorProgress`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L789) now gets the total progress and stage progress in addition to the current image
- `Session::run()` can no longer fail, and consumes the `Session`
- `Session::run()` now returns a `GeneratedImage` which can be used to get, save, or
stream the generated image (and maybe the debug ones)
- The CLI default values for the various available parameters now match the defaults
in the `SessionBuilder`, which means the examples provided in the README.md match

### Removed
- Replaced `load_examples`, `load_example`, `load_example_guides`, and `load_sampling_masks` with
[`add_example`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L366) and [`add_examples`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/blob/7e65b8abb9508841e7acf758cb79dd3f49aac28e/lib/src/lib.rs#L382) which work with `Example`(s)

### Fixed
- The top-level README.md is now deployed with both `texture-synthesis` and `texture-synthesis-cli` on crates.io

## [0.2.0] - 2019-08-27
### Added
- Split lib and cli into separate crates so CLI specific dependencies
weren't pulled in
- Add `GeneratorProgress` to allow progress of image generation to be reported to external
callers

## [0.1.0] - 2019-08-27
### Added
- Initial add of `texture-synthesis`
