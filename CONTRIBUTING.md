# Embark Contributor Guidelines

Welcome! This project is created by the team at [Embark Studios](https://embark.games). We're glad you're interested in contributing! We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds who are interested in making great software with us.

At Embark, we aspire to empower everyone to create interactive experiences. To do this, we're exploring and pushing the boundaries of new technologies, and sharing our learnings with the open source community.

If you have ideas for collaboration, email us at opensource@embark-studios.com.

We're also hiring full-time engineers to work with us in Stockholm! Check out our current job postings [here](https://www.embark-studios.com/jobs).

## Issues

### Feature Requests

If you have ideas or how to improve our projects, you can suggest features by opening a GitHub issue. Make sure to include details about the feature or change, and describe any uses cases it would enable.

Feature requests will be tagged as `enhancement` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.

### Bugs

When reporting a bug or unexpected behaviour in a project, make sure your issue descibes steps to reproduce the behaviour, including the platform you were using, what steps you took, and any error messages.

Reproducible bugs will be tagged as `bug` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.

### Wontfix

Issues will be closed and tagged as `wontfix` if we decide that we do not wish to implement it, usually due to being misaligned with the project vision or out of scope. We will comment on the issue with more detailed reasoning.

## Contribution Workflow

### Open Issues

If you're ready to contribute, start by looking at our open issues tagged as [`help wanted`](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"help+wanted") or [`good first issue`](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue").

You can comment on the issue to let others know you're interested in working on it or to ask questions.

2. Create a new feature branch.
